A Snakemake workflow for `Population Genomics analysis analysis in research`

# PoPGen Playground
## This repository is developed to facilitate easy-to-use population analysis of genomic data for new populations, specifically, for Ukrainian and Romanian populations genetated for "Partnership for Genomic Research in Ukraine and Romania" project EMS Code: 2SOFT/1.2/48"

Essentialy this Snakemake-based pipeline guides future users to be able to reproduce Population Genomics analysis released with the project. This pipeline is optimized for accessiblity, and is aimed to provide a comprehensive all-in-one solution for populations for comparative analysis. 

### 1) Identification and filtering of common medically relevant alleles for the population

### 2) Organizing existing published populations for comparative analysis(Currently supports The International Genome Sample Resource, Human Genome Diversity Project, Simons Genome Diversity Project -https://www.internationalgenome.org/home)

### 3) Phasing the datasets to obtain data ready for all the future analyses 

### 4) Principal Component Analysis and vizualization of selected populations

### 5) ADMIXTURE analysis and vizualization of investigated datasets

### 6) Comparative frequency analysis to identify Alleles unique to the population

Development was supported in part by 2SOFT/1.2/48 project "Partnership for Genomic Research in Ukraine and Romania" by the Joint Operational Programme Romania-Ukraine, through the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI).
